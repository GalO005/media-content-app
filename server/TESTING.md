# Testing Setup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to set up the testing environment for the Media Content App server.

## Changes Made

1. **Test Configuration**

   - Created `src/config/test.config.ts` with settings for test environment
   - Added sample test data and Elasticsearch configuration
   - Added support for environment variables to override settings

2. **Test Setup**

   - Created `tests/setup.ts` that runs before tests
   - Added conditional logic to use real services or mocks based on environment variables
   - Implemented test data loading for real Elasticsearch

3. **Docker Configuration**

   - Updated `docker-compose.yaml` to use environment variables for Elasticsearch URL
   - Configured the node-api service to connect to external Elasticsearch

4. **Test Scripts**

   - Added `test:docker` script to run tests in Docker environment
   - Added `test:integration` script to run tests with real services
   - Added `check:elasticsearch` script to verify Elasticsearch connection

5. **Wait-for-Services Script**

   - Created `scripts/wait-for-services.js` to check if external services are ready
   - Added retry logic and detailed error reporting

6. **Documentation**
   - Created `tests/README.md` with instructions for running tests
   - Added troubleshooting information for common issues

## How to Run Tests

### Unit Tests with Mocks

```bash
npm test
```

### Integration Tests with Real Services

```bash
export ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://your-elasticsearch-server:9200
npm run test:integration
```

### Tests in Docker Environment

```bash
export ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://your-elasticsearch-server:9200
docker compose up -d
npm run test:docker
```

## Next Steps

1. **Elasticsearch Connection**: Resolve the connection issues to your Elasticsearch server

   - Verify the URL and network access
   - Check if authentication is required
   - Consider using a VPN if the server is behind a firewall

2. **Additional Tests**: Add more tests for other components

   - Controllers
   - Services
   - Middleware
   - Utility functions

3. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically

   - GitHub Actions
   - Jenkins
   - GitLab CI

4. **Test Coverage**: Add test coverage reporting
   - Configure Vitest to generate coverage reports
   - Set coverage thresholds

## Conclusion

The testing environment is now set up to support both unit tests with mocks and integration tests with real services. The unit tests are passing, but there are issues connecting to the external Elasticsearch server that need to be resolved before the integration tests can run successfully.
